# LOIAML-MLP-Classification-with-PyTorch-and-Sklearn
The candidate should download a classification dataset from the UCI repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) or Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or any other source of their interest, compute the chi-squared correlation (independence) between two attributes, and perform classification using appropriate MLPs implemented with two different libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, or another library of interest to the candidate), after adequately defining the training and test sets.
