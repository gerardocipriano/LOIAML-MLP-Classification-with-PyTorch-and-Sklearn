# LOIAML-MLP-Classification-with-PyTorch-and-Sklearn
This GitHub repository contains Python code for data classification using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) implemented with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn. The code also includes computation of the correlation between two dataset attributes using chi-squared and evaluation of the models with classification report and confusion matrix.
